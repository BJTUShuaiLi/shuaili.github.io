I'm a first year Ph.D. student from [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://soms.bjtu.edu.cn/), [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes sparse optimization, 0/1 loss optimization, and binary optimization, with applications in artificial intelligence, signal processing, machine learning, etc.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shenglong Zhou](https://shenglongzhou.github.io/) from [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://soms.bjtu.edu.cn/), [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/).
